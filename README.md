# NASDAQ Website

## Image Instructions

Two banner images need to be saved to the public/images directory:

1. Save the NASDAQ/ELIZA OS banner image as: `public/images/nasdaq-eliza-banner.jpg`
2. Save the NASDAQ AI character image as: `public/images/nasdaq-ai-character.jpg`

The images were shared in the chat and need to be manually downloaded and saved to these locations for the banner to display properly.
